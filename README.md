## Cassandra operator
Build [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/instaclustr/cassandra-operator/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/instaclustr/cassandra-operator/tree/master)

### Project status: alpha

Major planned features have yet to be completed and API changes are currently planned, we reserve the right to address bugs and API changes in a backwards incompatible way before the project is declared stable. See [upgrade guide](./doc/user/upgrade/upgrade_guide.md) for safe upgrade process.

Currently user facing Cassandra cluster objects are created as [Kubernetes Custom Resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/extend-api-custom-resource-definitions/).

We expect to consider the Cassandra operator stable soon; backwards incompatible changes will not be made once the project reaches stability.

## Overview

The Cassandra operator manages Cassandra clusters deployed to [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) and automates tasks related to operating an Cassandra cluster.

## Requirements

- Kubernetes 1.13+
- Cassandra 3.11+

## Deploy Cassandra operator

See [instructions on how to install/uninstall Cassandra operator](./doc/op_guide.md) .

## Limitations

- This operator is currently a work in progress and breaking changes are landing in master all the time until we reach our initial release. Here be dragons!
- Do not use this in production... yet
- Please see the [Instaclustr supported projects page](https://www.instaclustr.com/support/documentation/announcements/instaclustr-open-source-project-status/) for the Enterprise support status of the Cassandra Operator.
