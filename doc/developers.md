## Developers Guide
### Operator
The main logic for the controller portion of the Cassandra operator can be found in cmd/ and pkg/ directories and is primarily 
written in Go. The sidecar can be found in java/ and is written in Java.

### Model
Defined kubernetes CRD objects can be found in the model/ module. These are defined by a json schema and there Java
classes are generated when the model/ module is built by maven. If you are having trouble with resolving model classes
in your IDE you made need to configure the target directory as a source/generated sources directory

### Backup
The somewhat stand-alone backup agent for Cassandra. It can be used as a separate stand alone backup process (controlled via
command line parameters) or embedded in the operator sidecar. 

### k8s-addons
This module contains add-on components that extend Cassandra and make it easier to work and operate in a Kubernetes environment.
The k8s-addon jar gets included Cassandra docker image and is dropped into the Cassandra classpath. 

## Building
To build the project, compile the go project, generate images and generate relevant jars, from the project root, run: 
```bash
make
```

This will by default build an images for your local image repo.

This behavior can be overridden by defining `NO_DEV`, `REGISTRY` and `TAG` environment variables.
